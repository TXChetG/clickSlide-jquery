Welcome to clickSlide.

A simple jQuery plugin for quickly implementing sliding drawer lists.

History: This plugin was born from my need for a simple bit of code to
accomplish my desired looked for a stylized FAQ page. The look and 
function of the code proved to be both successful and desireable on 
other pages as well. When I found myself copying and pasting the code 
to work with yet another selector, I decided it was time to turn it 
into a simple plugin.
